Wooden Ships & Iron Men

Wooden Ships & Iron Men is a tactical simulation of naval warfare during the
great age of sale.  The game covers the period from 1776 to 1814 when the
great square sail ships-of-the-line dominated the oceans and the speedy and
durable American frigates gave wold recognition to their young parent navy.

This project contains the following:
* docs/ The 3rd Edition of the WSIM manual including updates to clairify
  aspects of gameplay.  (Authored using Apple's Pages.app, part of the
  iWork productivity suite.)
* sail/ Unix command line, ASCII-art implementation of the WSIM game.  The
  code was found in the VINO OS (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/syrah/vino/)
  project and updated to build using GNU Autoconf.
* site/ What was the http://wsim.org/ web site before lawyers from Hasbro,
  the parent company of Wizards of the Coast a division of which is Avalon
  Hill, asked that it be taken down.

Although IANAL, I have determined that the trademark for "Wooden Ships &
Iron Men" is classified as "Dead"[1].
